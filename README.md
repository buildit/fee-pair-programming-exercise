Below you'll find the details necessary to complete the BuildIt front-end on-site coding challenge. If you have any questions while reading please email your point of contact for clarification.

# Interview Prep

Before arriving, we ask that you bootstrap an application using your favorite framework (React, Angular, Vue, etc) and configure testing (Jest, Jasmine, Mocha, etc). Please push this setup to github/bitbucket/gitlab, etc and email us the repo.

1. Setup a front-end coding environment capable of handling tests and API calls (Create React App, Angular CLI, ect)
    1. Place your coding environment in version control
    1. Email BuildIt with a link to your public version controlled files
1. Get an API key from the [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx)
    1. Bring this to your interview for API calls

*Note: Please donâ€™t do any application coding. We want to see how you setup a project, coding will be done during the interview.

# The Interview

You'll be coding with BuildIt's front-end developers to complete the following criteria.

1. Print a list of movie results from an OMDb search on a single page
1. Make a list of 3 different movie search queries on the same page
1. Clicking a search repopulates the movies with the query's results

## Test Criteria

We'd like to see the following tests to verify code integrity.

* An HTTP call is made
* Clicking a list item triggers intended functionality
* Assertion that movie data is being printed from a returned call

You're allowed to use search engines and tools such as Stackoverflow during the coding exercise. The goal here is to demonstrate how you work on a project.

The coding test is up to 2 hours and you might not finish. If you don't that's okay, you will be evaluated based upon the grading criteria instead of project completion.

**DISCLAIMER**: If you take longer than 40 minutes on a single task, we may end the test early. As you may not have enough time to finish.

## What criteria will I be evaluated on?
Candidates will be evaluated on the following criteria and how they approach it. While you're coding we encourage you to walk us through your thought process as it will play a large part in your scoring.

- Initial project setup
- Usage of JavaScript in relation to a production environment
- API Consumption
- Finalized code architecture
- Ability to work with your selected framework and tools
- Communication with code pair members
- Quality of written test(s)

## What to bring?
For the interview we ask that you please bring your laptop with the version controlled coding environment you've prepared. Candidates will be asked to complete the coding test with the setup they've brought.
