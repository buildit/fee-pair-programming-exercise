Below you'll find the details necessary to complete the BuildIt front-end on-site coding challenge. If you have any questions while reading please email your point of contact for clarification.

# Interview Prep
Before arriving, we ask that you bootstrap an application using your favorite framework (React, Angular, Vue, etc), setup CSS (Sass, SCSS, Bootstrap, etc), configure testing (Jest, Jasmine, Mocha, etc), and any additional tools that demonstrate your knowledge of architecting a front-end project. Please push this setup to github/bitbucket/gitlab, etc and email us the repo.

1. Setup a front-end coding environment with your favorite framework(s) and tools*
1. Place your coding environment in version control
1. Email BuildIt with a link to your publicly version controlled files

*Note: Please donâ€™t do any application coding. We want to see how you setup a project, application coding will be done during the interview.

# The Interview
Candidates will be leading a code pair interview with BuildIt devs on-site to complete the following.

1. Display an index page with all of the questions
1. Display a page with a single question and corresponding answers
1. Submitting a correct answer displays a success message
1. Submitting an incorrect answer displays an error
1. Submit your finalized code to version control

You're allowed to use search engines and tools such as Stackoverflow during the coding exercise. The goal here is to demonstrate how you work on a project.

The coding test is up to 2 hours and you might not finish. If you don't that's okay, you will be evaluated based upon the grading criteria instead of project completion.

**DISCLAIMER**: If you take longer than 40 minutes on a single task, we may end the test early. As you may not have enough time to finish.

## What criteria will I be evaluated on?
Candidates will be evaluated on the following criteria and how they approach it. While you're coding we encourage you to walk us through your thought process as it will play a large part in your scoring.


- Initial project setup
- Usage of JavaScript in relation to a production environment
- API Consumption
- Knowledge of CSS
- Mastery of HTML
- Finalized code architecture
- Ability to work with your selected framework and tools
- Communication with code pair members
- Did you write good test(s)

## What to bring?
For the interview we ask that you please bring your laptop with the version controlled coding environment you've prepared. Candidates will be asked to complete the coding test with the setup they've brought.

## The API
The following API end points are available to complete the on-site coding exercise. You are free to review these API end points beforehand.
