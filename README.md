This overview explains BuildIt's front-end on-site coding challenge. If you have any questions while reading please email your point of contact for clarification.

# Quick Overview

If you don't want to read the text below in detail (which we recommend) here is everything you need to know in bullet point form.

* You *must* come to the interview with the following 
  * Bring a scaffold (Create React App, Angular CLI) checked into public version control (Github, BitBucket)
  * Bring an API key generated from [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx)
  * Bring your laptop with the scaffold ready for coding
* Interview is a 2 hour test writing a simple single page app
* You are required to write some tests

# Interview Prep

Before arriving, we ask that you bootstrap an application using your favorite framework (React, Angular, Vue, etc) and configure testing (Jest, Jasmine, Mocha, etc). Please push this setup to public version control (Github, Bitbucket, ect) and email your contact a link to the repo.

1. Setup a front-end coding environment capable of handling tests and API calls (Create React App, Angular CLI, ect)
    1. Place your coding environment in version control
    1. Email your BuildIt contact with a link to your public repo
1. Get an API key from the [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx)
    1. Bring this to your interview for API calls

# The Interview

You'll be coding with BuildIt's front-end developers to complete the following criteria.

1. Print an OMDb search query as a list of movies on a single page (example https://www.omdbapi.com/?s=star_wars&apikey=YOUR_KEY)
1. Make a list of 3 different movie search queries on the same page
1. Clicking a search query replaces printed movies with the query's results

*Note: Please donâ€™t do any application coding yet. We want to see how you setup a project, coding will be done during the interview.

The coding test is up to 2 hours and you might not finish. If you don't that's okay, you will be evaluated based upon the grading criteria instead of project completion.

**DISCLAIMER**: If you take longer than 40 minutes on a single task, we may end the test early. As you may not have enough time to finish.

## Test Criteria

Please write the following tests to demonstrate code integrity with the least amount of code. Mocks, substitution, and other techniques are completely valid.

* An HTTP call is made
* Clicking a list item triggers intended functionality
* Verify that movie data is being printed from a returned call

## What resources are okay?

You're allowed to use search engines and tools such as Stackoverflow during the coding exercise. The goal here is to demonstrate how you work on a project.

## What criteria will I be evaluated on?

Candidates will be evaluated on the following criteria and how they approach it. While you're coding we encourage you to walk us through your thought process as it will play a large part in your scoring.

- Initial project setup
- Usage of JavaScript in relation to a production environment
- API Consumption
- Finalized code architecture
- Ability to work with your selected framework and tools
- Communication with code pair members
- Quality of written tests

## What to bring?

For the interview we ask that you please bring your laptop with the version controlled coding environment you've prepared. Candidates will be asked to complete the coding test with the setup they've brought.
